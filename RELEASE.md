## Description

The simulation evaluation tool is designed to assess the performance of hydrological simulations against observed hydrological data. It automates the process
of loading data from multiple catchments, computing key evaluation metrics, and generating visualizations for a comprehensive analysis. The tool outputs an
interactive HTML report containing performance summaries, time series plots, and statistical comparisons. The tool also outputs a .csv file conatining all the
metrics for the cathcments.
